The test_ck.cxx problem is a driver for the typical kinetics rhs
function and several ODE solvers that integrate the pTy systems
for constant pressure, homogeneous reactors.

The code has several parallel processing capabilities:
1) OpenMP for multi-core devices (CPU's and Intel Xeon Phi in native mode)
2) OpenCL for multi-core and many-core systems such as CPU's and GPU's.
3) OpenCL-SIMD for data-parallel systems such as CPU's and Xeon Phi's.

To build with OpenMP, simply enable on the command line via the Makefile:

prompt> make omp=1

To build with OpenCL, add `cl=1` to the `make` command. This requires that the
variable CLINCPATH in the Makefile be set to point to the location of the OpenCL
include files and CLLIBPATH to point to the system libraries.

The code must load a binary database with the mechanism information. Three are stored in the inputs/
directory. The mechanism file is specified at run-time on the CLI with the `-ck <filename>` syntax.

Other options include:

-read <filename>: load predefined problem profiles for temperature, pressure, and mass fraction.
-ck   <binfile> : load prebuilt mechanism file
-ros            : enable the Rosenbrock4 integrator (ROS4)
-rk             : enable the RungeKuttaFehlberg integrator (exclusive with -ros)
-tstop <value>  : specify the integration time for the ODE systems (1e-6)
-np  <num>      : number of problems to solve.
-nohost         : disable the host calculations. This is only useful when using OpenCL.
-cl_iters <num> : number of iterations over the problem set for the OpenCL driver.

Several OpenCL options are controlled by environmental variables, not the CLI.

VECTOR=<num>    : Controls the SIMD vector width. Must be a power-of-2 and >= 16
DEVICE=ACC|CPU  : Controls the destination of the OpenCL kernels: either the available accelerator (e.g., GPU or the host CPU)
BLOCKSIZE=<num> : Control the block-size (in CUDA terms); i.e., the # of threads per workgroup.
NUMBLOCKS=<num> : Control the number of thread-blocks
NP=<num>        : Controls the RHS test case size for OpenCL. The CLI option -np overrides.

For example, to run a set of 1600 premixed problems with the GRI Mech (v3) mechanism with the ROS4 integrator
and an integration time of 1e-6 on OpenCL with a SIMD width of 8 on one host CPU core and skip the baseline OpenMP host
reference, execute this:


VECTOR=8 DEVICE=CPU BLOCKSIZE=1 NP=0 NUMBLOCKS=1 ./test_ck.exe -read inputs/gri_premix_profile.bin -ck inputs/grimech.bin -ros -tstop 1e-6 -np 1600 -nohost
